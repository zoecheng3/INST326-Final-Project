## .gitignore
The purpose of this .gitignore file in this repository is to specify which patterns of files and directories that should not be tracked or committed to the repository. We are telling Git to ignore these files. These patterns are commonly ignored in Python. 



## LICENSE
The purpose of the LICENSE file in this repository is to define the terms and conditions under which the code in this repository can be distributed. It is an open-source license that is used to protect the freedom of users and promote the sharing and modification of software.



## pokemongame.py
The purpose of the pokemongame file is to run the pokemon wordle game itself. The pokemongame file consists of two classes; a player class and a game class. The user will be playing against another player in order to correctly guess a randomly generated Pokemon, chosen by the computer. The computer will provide the user with various hints such as whether the user's guess is in the correct generation or whether they have the right type 1/type 2. The user will have 8 tries to correctly guess the Pokemon before the game is over. Once the game is over, the game will display various stats on the user's guesses.



## Running this program
This program is designed to run from the terminal. To run it, open a terminal and ensure you are in the directory where your script is saved. Once you are in the correct directory, run the program by typing 'python pokemon_game.py' and press Enter. The program will start running, and you will see the game output in the command prompt or terminal. Follow the prompts and input your guesses when prompted. After playing the game, the program will display the guessing statistics in a bar chart and the distribution of user guesses in a histogram. You can play the game multiple times by entering 'y' when prompted to play again, or 'n' to exit the program.




## Output of this program
This program is a game designed to test the user's knowledge on various Pokemon. Based on the user's guess, the program will output a series of hints in order to assist the user in correctly identifying the correct Pokemon. At the very end of the game, the game will output what the correct Pokemon is as well as a distribution of the user's guesses in a histogram as well as their guessing statistics in a bar chart.
