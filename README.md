## pokemongame.py
The purpose of the pokemongame file is to run the pokemon wordle game itself. The pokemongame file consists of two classes; a player class and a game class. The user will be playing against another player in order to correctly guess a randomly generated Pokemon, chosen by the computer. The computer will provide the user with various hints such as whether the user's guess is in the correct generation or whether they have the right type 1/type 2. The user will have 8 tries to correctly guess the Pokemon before the game is over. Once the game is over, the game will display various stats on the user's guesses.
